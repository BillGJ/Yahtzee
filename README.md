# Yahtzee

This Java Program is just for fun. 
The goal is to get the number of times we need to roll five dice to have a Yahtzee!

## Output

The output should look something like this in the terminal
where the number of rolls is more likely to be something other than 754:

    We needed 754 rolls to get a Yahtzee!
